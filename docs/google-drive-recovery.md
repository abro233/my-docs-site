## 1. Introduction
Google Drive stores your files securely, but accidental deletion or missing files can cause frustration. This guide provides step-by-step solutions to recover lost files in Google Drive.

## 2. Check the Google Drive Trash

### Steps:
1. Open **Google Drive** ([drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com)).
2. Click on **Trash** in the left sidebar.

|--------|---------|

| Empty Trash | Permanently deletes all files in Trash |

## 3. Use the "Activity" Panel

If your file is not in Trash, it may have been moved or edited. You can check recent file activity to locate it.

### Steps:
1. Open **Google Drive**.
2. Click on **"My Drive"** in the left sidebar.
3. Click the **"i" (info) icon** in the top-right corner.

5. If you find your file's recent location, navigate there to recover it.

>  **Tip:** If someone else deleted the file in a shared folder, ask them to restore it.

## 4. Restore from "Shared with Me"

If you still cannot find your file, it may have been in the "Shared with Me" section. To check, follow these steps:

1. Open **Google Drive**.
2. Click on **Shared with Me** in the left panel.
3. Search for the missing file.
4. If deleted, ask the original owner to reshare it with you.
