## Overview

The first user test evaluated how effectively three test subjects were able to use the Green Clinic TechCare website to schedule a COVID-19 rapid test appointment and the Louisiana Tech website to report a positive COVID-19 result. The goal was to help the university understand how to proceed with classes after a student has tested positive. Each subject was tasked with completing these activities. The tests took place via Zoom between November 9 and November 12, 2021.

### The test subjects were:

- Charles Rand: Engineer from Monroe, LA
- Hannah Fulton: ULM student from Monroe, LA
- Ralph Brown: History professor at ULM, Monroe, LA

| Individual     | Status            | Date               | Location         |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Charles Rand   | Engineer          | 9 November 2021    | Local library    |
| Hannah Fulton  | ULM student       | 10 November 2021   | ULM dorm room    |
| Ralph Brown    | Professor         | 12 November 2021   | Home living room |

### Effective Elements

The following elements of the Green Clinic TechCare website contributed to the ease of scheduling a COVID-19 test:

| Element                               | Actions                                                                 | Comments                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| The calendar displaying available times | All test subjects used the calendar to schedule appointments quickly. | No issues reported.                                                                     |

### Ineffective Elements

The following elements of the Green Clinic TechCare website caused difficulty for the test subjects:

| Element                                             | Actions                                                                | Comments                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The “Schedule an Appointment” button is too small   | Some test subjects took extra time to locate this button.              | A larger button would make it easier to find.                                                    |
| The “What is your current status” option doesn’t clarify testing eligibility for non-faculty/staff | Test subjects were unsure if they could schedule a test as the option only included student or faculty status. | Clearer options for non-affiliated individuals would help.                                         |

### Suggested Improvements

While the “Book Now” button and the calendar displaying available times should be kept, there are two main areas for improvement:

| Effective (Keep)   | Ineffective (Revise)                       | Suggested Revision                                                        | Remove | Add  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------|
| “Book Now” button  | The “Schedule an Appointment” button is too small | Make this button larger to improve visibility                                |        |      |
| The calendar       | The “What is your current status” option doesn’t clarify testing eligibility for non-faculty/staff | Add clarification about who can be tested (e.g., non-affiliated individuals) |        |      |

### Ineffective Elements

The following elements of the Louisiana Tech website caused difficulty:

| Element                                                        | Actions                                                                | Comments                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The homepage doesn’t clearly show where to report a positive COVID test | Two subjects could not find the reporting page and abandoned the task. | Adding a dedicated “Coronavirus” section in the menu could help.                                  |
| No information on how to proceed with classes after testing positive for COVID | The one subject who continued could not find information about class procedures. | This information should be included on the “Quarantine and Isolation Protocol” page. |

### Suggested Improvements

The following revisions are suggested to improve the Louisiana Tech website’s user experience:

| Effective (Keep)                  | Ineffective (Revise)                         | Suggested Revision                                                    | Remove | Add  |

## Concluding Thoughts

Overall, the Green Clinic TechCare website was easy to use, with minor adjustments needed for button size and clarity about testing eligibility for non-affiliated individuals. For the Louisiana Tech website, the main improvement is making it easier to find where to report a positive COVID test and providing information about class procedures after testing positive.

### **Suggested Revisions and Reason for Changes**

| **Revisions** | **Reason** |
| --- | --- |
| Make the “Schedule an Appointment” button larger | This will make it easier for users to find and click the button |
