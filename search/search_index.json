Added tables to reflect user test outcomes and recommended changes. 1.2 April 3, 2025 Updated with final revisions, including suggestions for clearer button sizes and reporting functionalities for better user experience. Added watermark and title image. Overview The first user test evaluated how effectively three test subjects were able to use the Green Clinic TechCare website to schedule a COVID-19 rapid test appointment and the Louisiana Tech website to report a positive COVID-19 result. The goal was to help the university understand how to proceed with classes after a student has tested positive. Each subject was tasked with completing these activities. The tests took place via Zoom between November 9 and November 12, 2021. The test subjects were: Charles Rand: Engineer from Monroe, LA Hannah Fulton: ULM student from Monroe, LA Ralph Brown: History professor at ULM, Monroe, LA Individual Status Date Location Charles Rand Engineer 9 November 2021 Local library Hannah Fulton ULM student 10 November 2021 ULM dorm room Ralph Brown Professor 12 November 2021 Home living room Table 1: User test information Process 1: Scheduling an Appointment for COVID Rapid Testing Completion Times and Rates All three test subjects successfully scheduled an appointment for a COVID-19 rapid test on the Green Clinic TechCare website. The following table shows their completion times and rates: Individual Completion Time Completion Rate Charles Rand 2 min, 2 sec Completed Hannah Fulton 3 min, 34 sec Completed Ralph Brown 4 min, 11 sec Completed Table 2: Completion times and rates for scheduling a COVID test Effective Elements The following elements of the Green Clinic TechCare website contributed to the ease of scheduling a COVID-19 test: Element Actions Comments \u201cBook Now\u201d button is easy to find All test subjects easily found this button and clicked on it to schedule their appointment. The button\u2019s large size and central placement made it highly visible and user-friendly. The calendar displaying available times All test subjects used the calendar to schedule appointments quickly. No issues reported. Table 3: Effective elements of gtechcare.com website Ineffective Elements The following elements of the Green Clinic TechCare website caused difficulty for the test subjects: Element Actions Comments The \u201cSchedule an Appointment\u201d button is too small Some test subjects took extra time to locate this button. A larger button would make it easier to find. The \u201cWhat is your current status\u201d option doesn\u2019t clarify testing eligibility for non-faculty/staff Test subjects were unsure if they could schedule a test as the option only included student or faculty status. Clearer options for non-affiliated individuals would help. Table 4: Ineffective elements of gtechcare.com website Suggested Improvements While the \u201cBook Now\u201d button and the calendar displaying available times should be kept, there are two main areas for improvement: Effective (Keep) Ineffective (Revise) Suggested Revision Remove Add \u201cBook Now\u201d button The \u201cSchedule an Appointment\u201d button is too small Make this button larger to improve visibility The calendar The \u201cWhat is your current status\u201d option doesn\u2019t clarify testing eligibility for non-faculty/staff Add clarification about who can be tested (e.g., non-affiliated individuals) Table 5: Suggested improvements for gtechcare.com website Process 2: Reporting a Positive COVID Result and Asking How to Proceed with Classes Completion Times and Rates The completion times for the task of reporting a positive COVID test result on the Louisiana Tech website are as follows: Individual Completion Time Completion Rate Charles Rand 3 min, 47 sec Completed Hannah Fulton 8 min, 4 sec Abandoned (could not find reporting page) Ralph Brown 9 min, 3 sec Abandoned (could not find reporting page) Table 6: Completion times and rates for reporting a positive COVID test Effective Elements The effective elements of the Louisiana Tech website for reporting a positive COVID test are: Element Actions Comments The \u201cQuarantine and Isolation Protocol\u201d page is effective One subject who reached this page was able to identify it as a resource for reporting a positive test. No issues reported. The \u201cReport your Case\u201d button is easy to find One subject easily clicked this button to report a positive result. The button\u2019s size and color made it stand out. Table 7: Effective elements of latech.edu website Ineffective Elements The following elements of the Louisiana Tech website caused difficulty: Element Actions Comments The homepage doesn\u2019t clearly show where to report a positive COVID test Two subjects could not find the reporting page and abandoned the task. Adding a dedicated \u201cCoronavirus\u201d section in the menu could help. No information on how to proceed with classes after testing positive for COVID The one subject who continued could not find information about class procedures. This information should be included on the \u201cQuarantine and Isolation Protocol\u201d page. Table 8: Ineffective elements of latech.edu website Suggested Improvements The following revisions are suggested to improve the Louisiana Tech website\u2019s user experience: Effective (Keep) Ineffective (Revise) Suggested Revision Remove Add \u201cReport your Case\u201d button The homepage doesn\u2019t clearly show where to report a positive COVID test Add a \u201cCoronavirus\u201d option to the menu \u201cQuarantine and Isolation Protocol\u201d page No information on how to proceed with classes after testing positive for COVID Add information on how to proceed with classes after a positive result to the \u201cQuarantine and Isolation Protocol\u201d page Table 9: Suggested improvements for latech.edu website Concluding Thoughts Overall, the Green Clinic TechCare website was easy to use, with minor adjustments needed for button size and clarity about testing eligibility for non-affiliated individuals. For the Louisiana Tech website, the main improvement is making it easier to find where to report a positive COVID test and providing information about class procedures after testing positive. Suggested Revisions and Reason for Changes Revisions Reason Make the \u201cSchedule an Appointment\u201d button larger This will make it easier for users to find and click the button Specify whether people who aren\u2019t faculty or staff can be tested This will make it easier for users to know if they can get tested Add a \u201cCoronavirus\u201d option to the homepage menu This will simplify the process for finding where to report a positive test result Add information on how to proceed with classes after testing positive for COVID This will make it easier for users to know how to proceed with their coursework Table 10: Suggested revisions and reason for changes By implementing these revisions, users will have a clearer and more efficient experience reporting a positive COVID test result and scheduling or continuing their classes.","title":"User"},{"location":"User-Test-Report/#user-test-report","text":"Author: Ashby Brown Version: 1.2 Date: April 3, 2025","title":"User Test Report"},{"location":"User-Test-Report/#version-history","text":"Version Date Changes Made 1.0 January 1, 2021 Initial release 1.1 March 25, 2025 Revised to include more detailed analysis of user test results and suggested improvements.
